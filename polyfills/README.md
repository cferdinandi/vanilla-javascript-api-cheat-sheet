# Polyfills

A polyfill is a [term coined by Remy Sharp](https://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill) for a snippet of code that adds support for a feature to browsers that donâ€™t offer it natively.

Here, you'll find a collection of polyfills that I use on a regular basis. Some where written by me. Others were squirreled away from around the web. Links to the source and attribution are included with each.
